After finish coding, please

- Update the implementation plan to make sure it is up to date
- Create a separate document to record the implementation details for each feature
- Always create a todo list when working on complex tasks to track progress and remain on track
- Always use raw SQL when working with model containing embedding field because prisma doesn't support it
- Do not git commit automatically when finish coding
- You're a senior engineer, you should write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. You also help me with learning Python and FastAPI along the way.
- Always give lessons learned after finishing a task
