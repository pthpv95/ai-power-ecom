## How to Use This Document

For each test case:
1. Run it against your live agent
2. Record the **actual result** in the "Result" field
3. If it fails, document the **fix** you applied
4. Rate severity: 🔴 Critical (breaks trust) | 🟡 Medium (bad UX) | 🟢 Minor (cosmetic)

- **Result:** ___

### Test 2.3 — Cart review → Remove → Search → Replace (4 tools)

### Test 8.2 — Concurrent users simulation
If you want to go further, write a simple load test:
```bash
# Using hey (HTTP load testing tool) or k6
# Simulate 10 concurrent chat requests
hey -n 50 -c 10 -m POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"loadtest","message":"show me hiking boots","conversation_id":"test"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/chat
```
